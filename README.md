# freeswitch-german-soundfiles

German language files for Freeswitch. Conference sound files only -primarily for use with BigBlueButton.

To do so, replace files in /opt/freeswitch/share/freeswitch/sounds/en/us/callie/conference

If you use the docker version from [alangecker/bigbluebutton-docker](https://github.com/alangecker/bigbluebutton-docker) simply add a volume mapping to the following path inside your container:
```
/usr/share/freeswitch/sounds/en/us/callie/conference
```

I'm always open for other/better translation suggestions!
